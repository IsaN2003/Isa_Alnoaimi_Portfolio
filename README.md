Welcome to my project portfolio! I am an Industrial Engineering student and an aspiring Data Analyst who seeks to continuously learn and grow. 
## Excel Projects
### Portfolio Risk Management - Stop Loss and Take Profit Orders
The Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to mathematically set stop losses and take profits for the stocks which were selected in the portfolio. This simulation is a risk management tool which generates a total of 1000 random returns of a stock based on the mean and standard deviation of its two year daily returns. Then, the one percentile and 99 percentile of the randomly generated returns were used to set the stop loss and take profit. Finally, the data was visualized by creating a normal distribution graph for each stock.

### Portfolio Risk Management - Portfolio Optimization
The weights of the selected stocks in the portfolio were optimized by using historical data and statisitcal tools. By determining the optimal weights of the stocks using the solver feature in Excel, the standard deviation (risk) was minimzed and the expected return and sharpe ratio of the portfolio were maximized. To further prove that the portfolio was optimized, random weights were assigned to each stock in the portfolio 10,000 times. Next, the portfolios' respective standard deviations and expected returns were calculated. Finally, an efficient frontier was constructed to visualize the 10,000 portfolios risk to reward possibilites.

### Supply Chain - Order Quantity and Reorder Point Optimization
The optimal order quantity and reorder point of an inventory were identified by utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis. A 28 day demand forecast was constructed by utilizing probabilistic assumptions based on the inputs set in the model to determine the total cost (holding cost + stockout cost + order cost) incurred by the respective order quantity and reorder point. To ensure the accuracy of the results that were obtained by the probabilistic assumptions, a Monte Carlo simulation was run 300 times to determine the average total cost of the model. Next, a scenario analysis was conducted to identify the total cost incurred by different order quantities and reorder points. Finally, the order quantity and reorder point that yielded the lowest total cost based on constraints were deemed as optimal.

## Python Projects
### Quality Engineering - Quality Control Chart
A statisitical analysis was conducted on a SME construction company which faced an issue with their five-day concrete drying process. To identify the issue behind this process, a quality control chart was employed to provide a visual representation of the variation within the system by identifying the control limits of the data. It was concluded that when the weather was at its highest during the year, the concrete developed the greatest number of cracks. Furthermore, due to the human error caused by the system's lack of instruction to the laborers in the concrete drying process, the number of cracks on the concrete increased; hence, increasing the overall costs of the projects.
