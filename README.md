## Excel Projects
As a portfolio risk manager in the TradeQuest, I created two Excel projects to optimize the portfolio by minimizing the risks and maximizing the returns. 
### Portfolio Risk Management - Monte Carlo Simulation
In the first project, I utilized the Monte Carlo Simulation to mathematically set stop losses and take profits for the stocks which were selected in the portfolio. This simulation is a risk management tool which generates a total of 1000 random returns of a stock based on the mean and standard deviation of its two year daily returns. Then, the one percentile and 99 percentiles of the randomly generated returns are used to set the stop loss and take profit. Finally, the data was visualized by creating a normal distribution graph for each stock.
### Portfolio Risk Management-Portfolio Optimization
In the second project, I optimized the weights of the selected stocks in the portfolio by using historical data and statisitcal tools. By determining the optimal weights of the stocks using the solver feature in Excel, the standard deviation (risk) was minimzed and the expected return and sharpe ratio  of the portfolio were maximized optimally. To further prove that the portfolio was optimized, random weights were assigned to each stock in the portfolio 10,000 times. Next, the portfolios' respective standard deviations and expected returns were calculated. Finally, an efficient frontier was constructed to visualize the 10,000 portfolios risk to reward possibilites.
